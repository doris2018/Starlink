A Starlink Trajectory Visualization System based on ReactJS
•	Designed and developed a visualization dashboard using ReactJS and D3 to track satellites in real-time based on geo-location.
•	Built location, altitude, and duration-based selector to refine satellite search.
•	Animated selected satellite paths on a world map using D3 to improve the user friendliness.



✌️ Motivation

With this web application, it is easy to see sallites moving around the world. Have fun!



💎 Fuctionality

•	On the home page, the location, altitude and duration data need to be put to refine the satellite search.

•	Once the sallites from the list based on the search result, the satellites will be tracked in real-time based on geo-location.



🌠 Built With

•	A visualization dashboard using ReactJS and D3

•	Ant Design based web page with user friendly experiences
